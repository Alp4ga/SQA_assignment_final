## 1. Sprint backlog

| Priority | Backlog | User Story | Estimate | Point |
|:--------:|:-------:|------------|----------|:-----:|
|1         | Documentation | #1   | 30 minutes | 5   |
|2         | Architecture  | #2   | 1 hours    | 10  |
|3         | Development   | #3   | 2 hours    | 50  |
|4         | Documentation | #4   | 1 hours    | 20  |
|5         | Documentation | #5   | 1 hours    | 20  |

## 2. User Stories

### #1 Pull Request
As a developer I want to know how review a pull request.
- Write _review.md_ file with important content about pull request.

### #2 UML architecture
As a developer I want to know the architecture for the project.
- Create UML file with class, functions & attributes for the project.

### #3 Development Class & Tests
As a user I want to use the controller and be sure every function work correctly.
- Create tests function for each member function write in the UML.
- Create class & function for each class and function write in the UML.

### #4 Test coverage
As a user I want to be sure the all code is tested correctly and know how to use it.
- Create a file _test_coverage.md_ and explain how to test and use it.

### #5 Controller documentation
As a user I want to know how to use the controller class.
- In the file _README.md_ write a documentation how to use the controller.

## 3.Tasks estimation

It is difficult to estimate tasks without already done it before. I know for this project, I need 2 hours to develop the tests and code. Because I will create the architecture before with an UML file. The task __#4__ and __#5__ need 1 hour each because the documention will be done faster thant the developement.

## 4. Velocity

Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a Team can tackle during a single Sprint and is the key metric in Scrum. Velocity is calculated at the end of the Sprint by totaling the Points for all fully completed User Stories.
In our case we will count the total of the last column of the array for all the tasks completed.
